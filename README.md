lightview3
==========

lightview3 jquery based for attachments and IMG bbcodes, based on Stoker4.0 prettyphoto mod.

This is pretty much a clone of [Stoker4.0 prettyphoto mod](http://www.phpbb3bbcodes.com/viewforum.php?f=31) that has been made to work with [nick stakenburg lightview 3 jquery](http://projects.nickstakenburg.com/lightview)

It also hase been made to automatically work and resize images that use the stock [IMG] bbcode.

For attachments you need to have already enabled the creation of thumbanils via the ACP.

General Tab:

Attachment Settings.
